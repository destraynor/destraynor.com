  <p>Despite there clearly being a few companies here, I don't consider myself an active
  angel investor. Typically what happens here is that I learn about a new product, start
  using it, contact the founder via their Intercom messenger, and get to chatting.
  Occasionally there's something useful I can share from my experience growing
  Intercom and sometimes I am then invited into the next round raised.</p>

  <div class="investment-description">
    <p>I believe that most SaaS products share similar features. When those features are 1) important 2) hard to do well and 3) not a significant opporuntity to differentiate yourself, there is a market opportunity to outsource it to an expert. Algolia offers Search, as a Service.</p>

    <p>It took me 4-5 efforts to click with Coda. At first I thought it was a spreadsheet, then a Quip-esque hybrid product, then a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVj5RZOqwY">DabbleDB</a> (RIP) type product, then it finally clicked that this was a new way to connect information together in your business. It’s incredibly power, and has a great team and some good friends work there.</p>

    <p>Consider is my 3rd email investment. Email is hard. Stepen, Ben, and Bob did a hell of a job re-imagining email and adding ‘new-to-email’ features for the first time since Gmail. Ultimately it didn’t work out, but it was a great product achievement.</p>

    <p>The very second you hire someone you don’t personally know, you start to wonder about how to manage for their morale and engagement. The second that person grows a team, you start to think about company wide engagement. Rather than rely on 3rd party anonymous review sites, Culture Amp lets you survey your company periodically and learn how everyone feels. It’s a great product.</p>

  <div class="investment-description">
    <p>The folks at Frontline introduced me to Colm &amp; co. in the very early days. The problem space (design systems) is, to me, still maturing but what blew me away was the sheer pace of execution.

    <p>Notion is an operating system for work. Potentially for life. What’s most unique about Notion is that they do <em>everything</em> (Docs, Wiki, Database, Notes, etc.) but you can’t easily see the trade-off because they’ve done everything well. When you find out how few engineers they have, you’ll be shocked.</p>

  <div class="investment-description">
    <p>Product teams don’t build their own mapping features, payment systems, search enginers, or video callling. Instead they use Google Maps, Stripe, Algolia, and now Daily. I suspect future communication products will be expected to have a video chat feature (unless Around.co works out), and in that world Daily will power everyone’s calls.

    <p>Miro wasn’t the first company to attempt the “why can’t whiteboards go online” problem, but with Miro he has built an incredibly complete solution. As work gets more distributed, with or with Coronavirus, the sketchy/chatty/brainstormy interaction will need a software home. Slack isn’t it, nor is email or Basecamp, or anything that doesn’t let you draw, write, and talk in real time with colleagues. Miro is that home.</p>

  <div class="investment-description">
    <p>My belief on “speed as a differentiator” goes something like this. There’s tool time and task time. Tool time is the annoying clicking and navigating necessary to use the tool, for example, working out how to write a project update and who to send it to.  Task time is the thinking required to get the job done, for example what is the actual project update. Superhuman has shrank the small-but-hourly tool time of email to ~zero. And they’ve done it with a great product. Incredible.</p>
