          <p>I can never tell which causes more professional strife: unspoken expectations, or
unintended consequences.</p>

<p>Often they come hand in hand. It’s fair to say everyone has their hidden readme,
and part of the joy of getting to know someone personally is that you gradually get
to uncover it and watch it update itself over time.</p>

<p>Professionally we don’t often have the luxury of time, and there’s some really
important lines in your own little file, that sometimes you’re better off helping
people out. (I’ll drop the readme analogy now, truth be told I didn’t really like it as I
was typing it. But my deal with these posts is simple, no turning back.)</p>

<p>So what am I hear to write about today… Well, it started with Claire Hughes
Johnsons’s “<em><a href="http://growth.eladgil.com/book/the-role-of-the-ceo/insights-working-with-claire/">Working with Claire</a>.</em>”
After I read that I concluded “wow, I actually feel
like I could work with her after reading that” and “I’ve never even met her.” That got
me wondering what it’s actually like to work with Des. I don’t have the same clarity
that Claire does, but I generally speaking know what a good day and a bad day feel
like, so let’s start there.</p>

<h2 id="how-not-to-give-me-feedback">How not to give me feedback</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Blunt emails with criticism only, especially after working hard on something,
especially if I had fuck all help and it definitely wasn’t gonna happen without me.</li>
  <li>Using the idea that “everything can always be better” as a stick to beat good things
with.</li>
  <li>The sense that <em>feeling good about something we’ve just done</em> somehow immediately
<strong>needs</strong> to be stomped down with criticism and talk of the “next level”, lest we feel
good about ourselves for just a second.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="how-not-to-include-me-in-things">How not to include me in things</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Receiving the <em>end</em> of something when I wasn’t involved at the <em>start</em> of it. For example,
catching up on a decision that started from the wrong grounding, or an irrational
one. It’s hard to “get on board” without being able to reapply the decision logic. This
is doubly so when I wake up to it and can’t actually ask anything about it for 8 hours
or more.</li>
  <li>Having rallied a team around something, and getting them feeling a real sense of
ownership, it all gets blown away for some minor decision/correction, the cost of
which is many times greater than the perceived benefit.</li>
  <li>Ominous meetings with no agenda. Requests for same.</li>
  <li>The sense that new information always == correct information. As if something or
some<strong>one</strong> being <em>new</em> automatically is correct and we should change course from our
previous thinking. Especially if it’s just because no one bothered to understand our
previous thinking.</li>
  <li>New sudden drama created by one person becoming aware of some<strong>thing</strong> that has
been true (and not life or death) for quite a while.</li>
  <li>Peers going direct to my team when they should already know I’m on top of it.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="who-i-dont-work-well-with">Who I don’t work well with</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Working with cynics, people who assume we’re not coming from a good place.
Working with people with disproportionate default negative reactions to any new
news. People who can’t accept changes in their plans without a lot of exasperation.</li>
  <li>It makes me dread bringing any news to them which only makes it harder.</li>
  <li>Being a dumping ground for other people’s shit. People who show up to talk with
nothing other than problems for me, and genuinely no consideration for me or how
my day is going.</li>
  <li>Managing a disorganised group of people without a written record, and trying to
chase through the he-said she-saids of a project where there’s plenty of blame
going around.</li>
  <li>Being looped out of written communication at the time when I could help, and then
being lopped in once there’s a problem that needs fixing that I could have seen
coming 20 fucking miles away.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tasks-i-hate-doing">Tasks I hate doing</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Forcing content (as in, you need to give a talk about X at Y event).</li>
  <li>Anything that reduces or belittles the work involved in creating it. e.g. “Now give us
a great talk on <em>__</em>” etc.</li>
  <li>Editing words that are being put in my mouth, usually from Comms or Content. It
feels like I’m selling my credibility to help someone else meet their Q3 goal.
Similarly pitching stuff that’s stupidly weak to journalists. (Think SMS at
Websummit).</li>
</ol>
