&lt;p&gt;It’s marketing when it’s a story we’re told, it’s a brand when it’s a story we tell ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two areas where brands seem to perform best, one is to establish a market dominant position (e.g. Coca Cola, accept no substitute) , and the other is when there’s unlimited high end. Cigars, Whiskey, Brandy, are all obvious&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">EVERYTHING IS A BRAND Theme parks Water El Casei Immunitas Whiskeys Wine Football clubs</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Centered text with background</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/writing/2020/04/05/centered-text-with-background/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Centered text with background" /><published>2020-04-05T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-04-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/writing/2020/04/05/centered-text-with-background</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/writing/2020/04/05/centered-text-with-background/">&lt;p&gt;I can never tell which causes more professional strife: unspoken expectations, or
unintended consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often they come hand in hand. It’s fair to say everyone has their hidden readme,
and part of the joy of getting to know someone personally is that you gradually get
to uncover it and watch it update itself over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professionally we don’t often have the luxury of time, and there’s some really
important lines in your own little file, that sometimes you’re better off helping
people out. (I’ll drop the readme analogy now, truth be told I didn’t really like it as I
was typing it. But my deal with these posts is simple, no turning back.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what am I hear to write about today… Well, it started with Claire Hughes
Johnsons’s “&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://growth.eladgil.com/book/the-role-of-the-ceo/insights-working-with-claire/&quot;&gt;Working with Claire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;”
After I read that I concluded “wow, I actually feel
like I could work with her after reading that” and “I’ve never even met her.” That got
me wondering what it’s actually like to work with Des. I don’t have the same clarity
that Claire does, but I generally speaking know what a good day and a bad day feel
like, so let’s start there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-not-to-give-me-feedback&quot;&gt;How not to give me feedback&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blunt emails with criticism only, especially after working hard on something,
especially if I had fuck all help and it definitely wasn’t gonna happen without me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using the idea that “everything can always be better” as a stick to beat good things
with.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The sense that &lt;em&gt;feeling good about something we’ve just done&lt;/em&gt; somehow immediately
&lt;strong&gt;needs&lt;/strong&gt; to be stomped down with criticism and talk of the “next level”, lest we feel
good about ourselves for just a second.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-not-to-include-me-in-things&quot;&gt;How not to include me in things&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Receiving the &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; of something when I wasn’t involved at the &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; of it. For example,
catching up on a decision that started from the wrong grounding, or an irrational
one. It’s hard to “get on board” without being able to reapply the decision logic. This
is doubly so when I wake up to it and can’t actually ask anything about it for 8 hours
or more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Having rallied a team around something, and getting them feeling a real sense of
ownership, it all gets blown away for some minor decision/correction, the cost of
which is many times greater than the perceived benefit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ominous meetings with no agenda. Requests for same.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The sense that new information always == correct information. As if something or
some&lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; being &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; automatically is correct and we should change course from our
previous thinking. Especially if it’s just because no one bothered to understand our
previous thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New sudden drama created by one person becoming aware of some&lt;strong&gt;thing&lt;/strong&gt; that has
been true (and not life or death) for quite a while.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Peers going direct to my team when they should already know I’m on top of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-i-dont-work-well-with&quot;&gt;Who I don’t work well with&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working with cynics, people who assume we’re not coming from a good place.
Working with people with disproportionate default negative reactions to any new
news. People who can’t accept changes in their plans without a lot of exasperation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It makes me dread bringing any news to them which only makes it harder.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being a dumping ground for other people’s shit. People who show up to talk with
nothing other than problems for me, and genuinely no consideration for me or how
my day is going.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Managing a disorganised group of people without a written record, and trying to
chase through the he-said she-saids of a project where there’s plenty of blame
going around.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being looped out of written communication at the time when I could help, and then
being lopped in once there’s a problem that needs fixing that I could have seen
coming 20 fucking miles away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tasks-i-hate-doing&quot;&gt;Tasks I hate doing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forcing content (as in, you need to give a talk about X at Y event).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anything that reduces or belittles the work involved in creating it. e.g. “Now give us
a great talk on &lt;em&gt;__&lt;/em&gt;” etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Editing words that are being put in my mouth, usually from Comms or Content. It
feels like I’m selling my credibility to help someone else meet their Q3 goal.
Similarly pitching stuff that’s stupidly weak to journalists. (Think SMS at

  &lt;li&gt;Being a dumping ground for other people’s shit. People who show up to talk with
nothing other than problems for me, and genuinely no consideration for me or how
my day is going.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Managing a disorganised group of people without a written record, and trying to
chase through the he-said she-saids of a project where there’s plenty of blame
going around.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being looped out of written communication at the time when I could help, and then
being lopped in once there’s a problem that needs fixing that I could have seen
coming 20 fucking miles away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tasks-i-hate-doing&quot;&gt;Tasks I hate doing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forcing content (as in, you need to give a talk about X at Y event).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anything that reduces or belittles the work involved in creating it. e.g. “Now give us
a great talk on &lt;em&gt;__&lt;/em&gt;” etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Editing words that are being put in my mouth, usually from Comms or Content. It
feels like I’m selling my credibility to help someone else meet their Q3 goal.
Similarly pitching stuff that’s stupidly weak to journalists. (Think SMS at
Websummit).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was when the last piece of hope left, and my heart sank, and my mind, body, and soul faded away. I don’t know if they’ve ever really recovered, but maybe you don’t recover. You just change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember so much about my mother, that’s never been a problem. In many ways I never really left home, I was there with her every step of the way from when I was born through when I was 30 and starting Intercom through when she left us. She was always so supportive of everything I ever tried, I could have been truly woeful at something and she’d tell me to keep going. I could be clearly talented and she’d say “keep going”. No matter what &lt;em class=&quot;text-subtle-emphasis&quot;&gt;just keep going.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two things that stuck with me that I’ll write about here because writing helps me get my head straight, and sometimes that’s exactly what I need. This won’t be a good piece, nor is it complete enough. But it’s a start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly she was &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; a parent. As I’ve grown up and witnessed how people parent their kids, and there’s 2 distinct ways I see. Some believe parenting is a skill you use when needed, when there are parenting moments where you must step up and teach the child what they did right or wrong. In those moments the child learns and you’ve done your job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alternative and the one outlined by Clay Christensen in “How will you measure your life”, is the one that resonates with me more. You’re &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; parenting, especially when you don’t want to be. Your child learns from every single thing you do. Every time you show patience, every time you show kindness, fear, anger, bitterness, resentment, jealousy, pride, compassion, you name it. You are always teaching your children, you can’t switch it on &amp;amp; off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the mother that she was to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, randomly, was the Amiga 500. Yes, you read that right. I’m the youngest of seven children and when I was 5 my Dad left the house (or was asked to leave to live with his new partner), and that left my Mam to look after me and 4 others. This was 1980s Dublin. Money was beyond tight and she had to look after 5 kids, 4 in school, with no job, and somehow make ends meet. And still, one March for my birthday, I got this…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/writing/essays/she-would-have-been-80-today/amiga.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Amiga&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the fuck did she get the money to get me an Amiga 500?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously. I know I wanted it more than anything and I probably literally never shut up about it. But I think it was £700 Irish pounds. I just had to look up how to type £, that’s how far back we’re going. And because of that, I learned to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workbench_(AmigaOS)&quot;&gt;Amiga Workbench&lt;/a&gt;, I learned &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOS_(programming_language)&quot;&gt;AMOS&lt;/a&gt;, I learned how to change memory contents while playing computer games using the incredible &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Replay&quot;&gt;Action Replay&lt;/a&gt; and because of that (and the incredible support of a friend and his family) I realized I was good at computers. I got them. They seemed to understand me. And because of that I studied computer science and software engineering and because of that I met &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davebarrett&quot;&gt;David Barrett&lt;/a&gt; and because of that I started a blog (originally held on this very domain) and because of that I wrote about programming, design, and usability, and because of that met &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/eoghan&quot;&gt;Eoghan&lt;/a&gt;, and we started an agency called Contrast and David joined and because of all that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.intercom.com&quot;&gt;Intercom&lt;/a&gt; got started in 2011. We used to day dream about the idea that Intercom could go on to be worth, &lt;em&gt;who knows,&lt;/em&gt; maybe $50 million one day. &lt;em&gt;Maybe. Who knows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if it ever was I swore to myself, that I’d pay my Mam back for that Amiga 500 1,000 times over. And then after December 10th, 2012 3:10pm, it was no longer possible to pay her back at all, she was gone. But I’ll make it up to her, that I promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today my mother Nancy Traynor should have turned 80 and today my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BntweI9HAUV/&quot;&gt;daughter&lt;/a&gt; Nancy Traynor turns 5 months old. I’ll do my best to look after the latter until I see the former again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, dear reader, this is probably a tough read for you. That’s actually true whether you have 0, 1, or 2 parents. All I can say is spend a lot of time with them if they’re still here. (And now a rant will follow…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See that’s the one tip that gets missed in every single bullshit guru tweetstorm about how to bleed every last piece of productivity from every second you have to spare. Wake up at 5am, fast, cycle, spin, work, learn, read, tweet about reading, exercise, fast, are-you-reading-yet, sleep early in a cool dark room with a air purifier, read again, don’t forget to journal, do this until it’s time for brunch on Saturday!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But look around you, all these people will be gone one day, especially the ones who spent their whole lives looking after you, yes you. Think about that once in a while. Spend your time, love, energy, and emotion accordingly. Know this: &lt;strong&gt;inside every 80 year old is an 18 year old wondering what the fuck just happened.&lt;/strong&gt; We’ll all get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raymond Carver (also died of lung cancer), wrote this last piece (Late Fragment) from his deathbed: &lt;em class=&quot;text-subtle-emphasis&quot;&gt;“And did you get what you wanted from this life, even so? I did. And what did you want? To call myself beloved, to feel myself beloved on the earth.”&lt;/em&gt; It’s good to think about that idea from time to time. What are you actually working toward?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s taken me ~6 years to actually publish this, and let’s be honest, it’s certainly not because I took the time to write it well, right? Some personal pieces are just too hard to click publish on because your feelings keep evolving and you’re never sure it’s final because your life is still going and well there’s always better and more respectful ways to phrase things, but screw it, it’s done now. Happy birthday Mam, I love you, and I swear I’ll keep going ❤️&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Here’s some words you don’t ever want to hear: “It’s on her liver, now”.</summary></entry></feed>
