	I can never tell which causes more professional strife unspoken expectations, or unintended consequences. Often they come hand in hand. It's fair to say everyone has hidden readme, and part of the joy of getting to know someone personally is that you gradually get to uncover it and watch it update. Professionally we don't often have the luxury of time, and there's some really important lines in your own little file, that sometimes you're better off helping people out. I'll drop the readme analogy now, truth be told I didn't really like it as I was typing it. But my deal with these posts is simple, no turning back.

<p> So what am I hear to write about today&#8230; Well, it started with Claire Hughes Johsons's "<a href="http://growth.eladgil.com/book/the-role-of-the-ceo/insights-working-with-claire/">working with Claire</a>". After I read that I concluded "<i>wow, I actually feel like I could work with her after reading that</i>" and I've never even met her. That got me wondering what it's actually like to work with Des. I don't have the same clarity that Claire does, but I generally speaking know what a good day and a bad day feel like, so let's start there.  </p>
