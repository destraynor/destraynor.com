    <h1>She would be 80 today</h1>
	</div>
<div style="font-size:18px;">	
<p>Here&#8217;s some words you don't ever want to hear: &ldquo;It&#8217;s on her liver, now&rdquo;. </p>

<p>That was the last piece of hope that left and my heart sank and my mind, body, and soul sank. I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;ve ever really recovered. </p>

<p>I remember so much about my mother, that&#8217;s never been a problem. In many ways I never really left home, I was there with her every step of way from when I was born through when I was 30 and starting Intercom through when she left us. She was always so supportive of everything I ever tried, I could have been the worst at it and she&#8217;d tell me to keep going. I could be clearly talented and she&#8217;d say "keep going".</p>

<p>Two things that stuck with me that I&#8217;ll write here because writing is therapy. </p>

<p>Firstly she was always a parent. As I&#8217;ve grown up and witnessed how people parent their children, there&#8217;s 2 distinct ways people do it. Some believe parenting is a job they have certain hours of the day and that there are parenting moments where you must step up and teach the child what they did right or wrong. </p>

<p>The alternative take, and the one outlined by Clay Christensen in &ldquo;How will you measure your life&rdquo;, is the one that resonates with me more. You&#8217;re always parenting. Your child learns from every single thing you do. Every time you show patience, every time you show kindness, fear, anger, bitterness, resentment, jealousy, pride, compassion, you name it. You are always teaching your children, you can&#8217;t switch it on & off.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the mother that she was to me. </p>

<p>Secondly was the Amiga 500. Yes, you read that right. I&#8217;m the youngest of seven children and when I was 5 my Dad left the house (or was asked to leave to live with his new partner), that left my Mam to look after myself and 4 others (two had already flown the coop). This was 1980s Dublin. Money was tight and she had to look after 5 kids, 4 in school, with no job, and make ends meet. And one March for my birthday I found this&#8230;</p>

	<p>Where the fuck did she get the money to get me an Amiga 500? </p>
	<p>Seriously. I think it was £700 Irish pounds. I just had to look up how to type £, that's how far back we&#8217;re going.  And because of that, I learned to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workbench_(AmigaOS)">Amiga Workbench</a>, I learned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOS_(programming_language)">AMOS</a>, I learned how to change memory contents while playing computer games using the incredible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Replay">Action Replay</a> and because of that (and the incredible support of a friend and his family) I realized I was good at computers. I got them. They seemed to understand me. And because of that I studied computer science and software engineering and because of that I met <a href="twitter.com/davebarret">David Barrett</a> and because of that I started a blog (originally held on this very domain) and because of that I wrote about programming, design, and usability, and because of that met <a href="twitter.com/eoghan">Eoghan</a>, and we started an agency called Contrast and David joined and because of all that <a href="http://intercom.com">Intercom</a> got started in 2011. We used to day dream about the idea that Intercom could go on to be worth, <i>who knows</i>, maybe $50 million one day. <i>Maybe</i>.  <i>Who knows.</i> </p>

<p>And if it ever was I swore to myself, thatI&#8217;d pay my Mam back for that Amiga 500 1,000 times over. And then after December 10th, 2012 3:10pm, it was no longer possible to pay her back at all, she was gone. But I&#8217;ll make it up to her, that I promise. </p>

<p>Today my mother Nancy Traynor should have turned 80 and today my daughter Nancy Traynor turns 5 months old. I&#8217;ll do my best to look after the latter until I see the former again. </p>

<p>I know, dear reader, this is probably a tough read for you. That&#8217;s actually true whether you have 0, 1, or 2 parents. All I can say is spend <em>a lot</em> of time with them if they&#8217;re still here. That&#8217;s the one tip that gets missed in every single bullshit guru tweetstorm about how to bleed every last piece of productivity from every second you have to spare. Wake up at 5am, fast, cycle, spin, work, learn, read, read, exericse, fast, are-you-reading-yet, sleep early in a cool dark room with a air purifier, read again, don't forget to tweet about it. But look around you folks, all these people will be gone one day, especially the ones who spent their whole lives looking after you. Think about that once in a while. Spend your time love energy and emotion accordingly. Know this: inside every 80 year old is an 18 year old wondering what the fuck just happened. Raymond Carver (who also died of lung cancer), wrote this last piece on his deathbed: <i>And did you get what you wanted from this life, even so? I did. And what did you want? To call myself beloved, to feel myself beloved on the earth.</i></p>
	
<p>It's taken me ~6 years to actually publish this, and let&#8217;s be honest, its certainly not because I took the time to write it well. Some personal pieces are just hard to click publish on because your feelings keep evolving and you're never sure it&#8217;s final because your life is still going and well there's always better more respectful ways to phrase things, but screw it here goes.</p>
