	I can never tell which causes more professional strife unspoken expectations, or unintended consequences. Often they come hand in hand. It's fair to say everyone has hidden readme, and part of the joy of getting to know someone personally is that you gradually get to uncover it and watch it update. Professionally we don't often have the luxury of time, and there's some really important lines in your own little file, that sometimes you're better off helping people out. I'll drop the readme analogy now, truth be told I didn't really like it as I was typing it. But my deal with these posts is simple, no turning back. 
</p>
<p> So what am I hear to write about today&#8230; Well, it started with Claire Hughes Johsons's "<a href="http://growth.eladgil.com/book/the-role-of-the-ceo/insights-working-with-claire/">working with Claire</a>". After I read that I concluded "<i>wow, I actually feel like I could work with her after reading that</i>" and I've never even met her. That got me wondering what it's actually like to work with Des. I don't have the same clarity that Claire does, but I generally speaking know what a good day and a bad day feel like, so let's start there.  </p>



<h2>How I take feedback</h2>
<ol>
<li>1. Blunt emails with criticism only, especially after working hard on something, especially if I had fuck all help and it definitely wasn’t gonna happen without me. </li>
<li>2. Using the idea that “everything can always be better” as a stick to beat good things with. </li>
<li>3. The sense that “/feeling good about something we’ve just done/” somehow immediately *needs* to be stomped down with criticism and talk of the “next level”, lest we feel good about ourselves for just a second. </li>
</ol>

<h2>How to include me in things</h2>

<ol>
	<li>1. Receiving the /end/ of something when I wasn’t involved at the /start/ of it. For example catching up on a decision that started from the wrong grounding, or an irrational one. It’s hard to “get on board” without being able to reply the decision logic. This is doubly so when I wake up to it and can’t actually ask anything about it for 8 hours or more. </li>
<li> Having rallied a team around something, and getting them feeling a real sense of ownership, it all gets blown away for some minor decision/correction, the cost of which is many times greater than the perceived benefit. </li>
<li> Ominous meetings with no agenda. Requests for same. </li>
<li> The sense that new information always == correct information. As if some*thing* or some*one* being “/new/” automatically is correct and we should change course from our previous thinking. Especially if it’s just because no one bothered to understand our previous thinking. </li>
<li> New sudden drama created by one person becoming aware of something that has been true (and not life or death) for  quite a while. </li>
<li> Peers going direct to my team when they should already know I’m on top of it. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Who I don’t work well with</h2>
<ol>
<li>1. Working with cynics , people who assume we’re not coming from a good place </li>
<li> Working with people with disproportionate default negative reactions to any new news.  People who can’t accept changes in their plans without a lot of exasperation. It makes me dread bringing any news to them which only makes it harder. </li>
<li> Being a dumping ground for other people’s shit. People who show up to talk with nothing other than problems for me, and genuinely no consideration for me or how my day is going. </li>
<li>Managing a disorganised group of people without a written record, and trying to chase through the he-said she-saids of a project where there’s plenty of blame going around. </li>
<li>Being looped out of written communication at the time when I could help, and then being lopped in once there’s a problem that needs fixing that I could have seen coming 20 fucking miles away.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tasks I hate doing</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Forcing content (as in, you need to give a talk about X at Y event).  </li>
<li> Anything that reduces or belittles the work involved in creating it. e.g. “Now give us a great talk on ____” etc. </li>
<li> Editing words that are being put in my mouth, usually from Comms or Content. It feels like I’m selling my credibility to help someone else meet their q3 goal. Similarly pitching stuff that’s stupidly weak to journalists. (Think SMS at Websummit). </li>
</ol>
