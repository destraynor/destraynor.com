          <p>Hey! I&#8217;m <a href="https://twitter.com/destraynor">Des</a>/. I am a cofounder of <a href="intercom.com">Intercom</a>. That&#8217;s probably how you have heard of me. That or you've read some of my essays, seen me speak, listened to a podcast I was on, or found me through Twitter. In any case, hi!</p>

	<div class="instructions">
		<p>Here's the stuff I&#8217;m known for&#8230;</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="essays.html">Essays</a> - I write about how to build, launch, market, and manage products. That's most of my career to date. </li>
			<li><a href="talks.html">Talks</a> - I talk about the same stuff, but I also talk about starting a startup too. </li>
			<li><a href="interviews.html">Interviews/Podcasts</a> - Whenever someone has a good set of questions, I enjoy a conversation with them</li>
			<li><a href="http://instagram.com/destraynor">Photos</a> - It's important to have a life away from the keyboard - this is a public glimpse into mine</li>
			<li><a href="http://linkedin.com/destraynor">LinkedIn</a> - I honestly don't know why I have a LinkedIn, or why you'll try connect with me now, but here we are.</li>
			<li><a href="questions.html">Q&A</a> — I'm not actually known for this, it's something I'm slowly working on</li>
